# Command Line File Manager

This CLI uses the native Windows terminal, built with visual studio and vs code. The terminal itself was developed with C#, with all underlying logic handled by Rust. C# passes input and recieves output from a dump via text file, controlled by Rust modules. 

This file manager provides more efficient and memory safe operations using Rust's strict type system, bundled with data structures like linked lists for caching.
